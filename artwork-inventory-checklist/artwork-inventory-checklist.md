# Artwork Inventory Checklist
This document is an aid for assessing the types of information you can use to catalog your artwork in an inventory system. Check off information you are already including, making note of fields you are missing and would like to add.

We also offer this same information as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0K0v_-4mh6pBY6QPXkCZNGxTWpz3DqlbmL-1ddg9j0/edit).
